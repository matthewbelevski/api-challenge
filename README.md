# api-challenge

For the Python API Challenge, the task was to generate a list of 500+ unique cities using a random list of latitude and longitude coordinates and the Python Library Citipy. From this list of cities and the Openweather API, the next task was to find the Max Temperature (F), Humidity (%), Cloudiness (%) and Wind Speed (mph) of these cities and then perform a linear regression analysis to determine whether there is a relationship between this data and the Latitiude of the city.

The next task was to use the Google Maps API to plot this data on a map using the humidity of the cities as the heat map. Then using the Google Maps Places API and filtering down for our ideal weather for a vacation, we were to find the nearest hotels based on the coordinates of the city.
